# Python Module 08: The Matrix

A Python project designed for data engineering students. This module focuses on architecting robust data systems by mastering environment isolation, dependency management, and secure configuration, following the official "The Matrix" subject.

This project introduces fundamental data engineering tools, including virtual environments (venv), package managers (Pip and Poetry), and the use of environment variables for secure system configuration.

## Given Rules
- Your code must be written in Python 3.10 or later.
- Your code must respect the flake8 linter standards.
- All functions and methods must include type hints.
- Your functions should handle exceptions gracefully using try-except blocks.
- Follow Python naming conventions (snake_case for variables and functions).
- Each exercise must be completed in its own directory: ex0/, ex1/, ex2/.
- Submit your work to your assigned Git repository.

## Exercises

### Exercise 0: Entering the Matrix
Create a program `construct.py` that detects if it is running inside a virtual environment, displays environment information, and provides setup instructions if no isolation is detected.

### Exercise 01: Loading Programs
Build a data analysis tool `loading.py` using pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. This exercise demonstrates mastery of dependency management using both `requirements.txt` (Pip) and `pyproject.toml` (Poetry).

### Exercise 02: Accessing the Mainframe
Develop a secure configuration system `oracle.py` using `python-dotenv`. Learn to manage sensitive information like API keys and database URLs through environment variables and `.env` files.
